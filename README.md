Quantum Darts game in PyGame

We did not have time to properly make a Github repository so just copy paste the main function in your favorite IDE and it will work.
You will also need to install PyGame for the script to run with "pip install pygame" (or "pip3 install pygame")
You also need matplotlib, scipy and numpy but if you're doing this Hackathon you should have that already
